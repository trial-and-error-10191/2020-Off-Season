Hey! We're FTC#10191 "Trial and Error Robotics" a community-based FTC team in Vicksburg MS. Founded in 2015 we have been a community-based team for the duration of our existence, this means we are not affiliated with any school district. Because of this, unlike many other teams which meet in schools, we meet at an army engineering center called ERDC (Engineering Research and Development Center)

Here on our website, you'll find plenty of information regarding information on our team, its history, and its members, so enjoy your stay!
